- system start up:
	- there are three component which we need to start up the system: bootloader, kernel, init process 
	- bootloader:
		- it is very hardware dependent 
		- the job is to initalize the hardware and start up the kernel
	- kernel:
		- at the begining run hardware dependent code which is responsible for initializing the hardware and then would call kernel_startup
		- kernel_startup:
			- high level initalizaion, mount rootfs, start init process 

- linux kernel:
	- kernel lives in kernel space and can access harware and io directly 
	- user space is where user code is excuted, it has less privilge and communicate with the kernel using system call 
	- at any time point the kernel is in one of three state
		- user space executing user code
		- kernel space in process context in bahalf of a process
		- kernel space in interrupt context 

- monolthic kernel:
	- the kernel is executed as one process and the communication with the user space is achieved using system call

- mikro kernel:
	- the kernel is divided to many process which would communicate with each other using IPC
